/**
 * Tests a Quarkus application whose engine writes into a database of its own, and what a
 * workflow which the engine rolled back leaves behind.
 * <p>
 * The engine writes to a resource which the application's own persistence does not take part in.
 * Two data sources in one JTA transaction are still two commits. So the outbox entry which reports
 * what the engine did cannot join the engine's commit, however the container enlists them. That
 * is why the entry gets a transaction of its own. This answer is honest, but not exact: the entry
 * and the engine's work commit separately, and the entry of a workflow the engine rolled back is
 * written and stays. The dispatch keeps such a workflow out of the cockpit. It asks the engine
 * about the workflow, the engine has none, and an event about a workflow nobody knows is dropped
 * and not sent.
 * <p>
 * The Camunda 7 adapter answers whether an engine shares the caller's transaction, and reads it
 * from the engine it built. This test pins the answer for an engine with a data source of its own,
 * because that answer decides where the entry goes.
 * <p>
 * Neither data source of this application is configured as XA, and that is part of what this test
 * shows. XA was the price of the old answer, where the entry joined the engine's JTA transaction.
 * There, a second data source is only enlisted as an XA resource, so without XA the entry failed
 * while the engine worked. Now the entry has a transaction of its own. It enlists nothing of the
 * engine and needs nothing declared. An application may still declare its data sources as XA for
 * reasons of its own, and that changes nothing here.
