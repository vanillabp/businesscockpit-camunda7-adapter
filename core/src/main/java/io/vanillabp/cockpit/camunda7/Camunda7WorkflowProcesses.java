/**
 * Which BPMN processes of which workflow modules this application deployed and claims, and how
 * to get from an engine's own identifiers back to them.
 * <p>
  * An engine reports a task or a history event with the process definition key and the tenant it
  * stored. Both of those depend on the name-clash avoidance the module was deployed with. The
  * translation back is therefore not a string operation but a lookup. Every process a
  * <code>&#64;WorkflowService</code> claims is remembered here while the deployment pipeline runs.
  * An event of a process which is not in here belongs to something else: a process the module
  * deploys for somebody else, another application on the same database, or a process definition
  * of an earlier release which is no longer part of this one.
 * <p>
 * The reverse map is built per adapter id and thrown away whenever a process is added, which
 * happens a handful of times while the application starts and never afterwards.
 * <p>
 * Why a lookup rather than a prefix somebody cuts off a string is decision 4 in the repository's
 * DECISIONS.md.
