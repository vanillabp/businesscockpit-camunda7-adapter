/**
 * How one configured Camunda 7 engine names the things the extension asks it about.
 * <p>
  * Name-clash avoidance decides whether a workflow module's processes are deployed under a
  * tenant, under a prefixed process id or under neither. Every query the extension sends to an
  * engine has to spell the id the way that engine stores it. The rules are the adapter's, so they
  * are asked of the adapter rather than rebuilt here. A prefix which the extension assembles
  * itself drifts apart from the adapter's on the next change.
 * <p>
  * The tenant is the adapter's own answer, not a property read a second time. It may be
  * configured for a workflow module and for the adapter. Which of the two a module runs under is
  * what the adapter resolves when it deploys that module. Asking anywhere else means querying a
  * tenant the engine never stored.
 * <p>
  * The version of a deployed process is asked here as well. It is not a name, but it is the
  * same kind of answer: the adapter knows it, both halves of this extension have to spell it
  * alike, and working it out a second time would let them drift apart.
 * <p>
  * That answer is asked for when it is needed rather than when this scope is built. An engine is
  * built with what this extension contributes to it, so there is nothing to ask about the engine
  * while it is being built. By the time anything is reported or read back, the engine exists.
